                                    The Elder Gods, five extremely powerful and immortal beings able to give rise to sentient life and entire planetary systems or even realms, hatch from Freneskae's Elder Halls and destroy the universe, except for Freneskae itself. One of them, Mah, is deemed stillborn, although she later emerges from her egg as well. Using sacred clay from the Primordial Realm, the other four begin crafting worlds to provide themselves with sufficient anima. To achieve this, Jas and a few others created twelve powerful artefacts to serve as conduits for their immense power and more finely shape their creations.

                                    The TokHaar are created from Ful's Elder Kiln, one of the twelve artefacts, to build mountains on the worlds. However, the Kiln is taken away from each imperfect world created, leaving the TokHaar behind. Despite this, the Kiln is always able to spawn new ones.

                                    Jas enslaves the Dragonkin, a race of reptile-like creatures who had survived the Great Revision by hiding in the Abyss, who become bound to protect the Stone of Jas, the most powerful artefact in the entire multiverse. They are cursed to feel torment and anger if the stone is abused (if it is used by a False User), forcing them to kill the False User, becoming more powerful in the process.

                                    Mah emerges from her egg, but is purely instinctual without any memory or knowledge. Desiring company, she creates two "toys" for herself, the gods Zaros and Seren. The former soon leaves her to explore other worlds, such as Infernus and Vampyrium, while Seren remains with her creator out of empathy. Mah begins creating other races as well, divided in tribes such as the Mahjarrat and the Chelon-Mah. Eventually, however, Seren leaves as well and comes to live with the elves on Tarddiad.

                                    Jas, Ful, Wen and Bik create a planet called Gielinor, along with a moon called Zanaris. It is the perfect creation they had been wanting to make and as such see their work as complete. After conveying orders to the TokHaar to shape it, the Elder Gods, in the TokHaar's words, "lied down upon their perfect world and spoke no more", leaving their fate ambiguous. Their Elder Artefacts, some of which on Gielinor, remain scattered around the multiverse. The Anima Mundi is also collaterally created, the very force of Gielinor that contains the divine energy from which all plant life emerged.

                                    Using the scattered Elder Artefacts, various mortals attain godhood themselves, though their power would never come to match the Elder Gods'. For instance, Saradomin, a human from Teragard becomes a god, quite possibly with the use of the Crown Archival. Gielinor remains undiscovered.

                                    In the realm of the Naragi, a peaceful race of craftsmen and farmers, war breaks out when Saradomin arrives and destroys the city of Askroth after being defied by them. However, his Crown attracts a mindless boar-like goddess, whom the Naragi dub Tuska and who proceeds to attack Saradomin, destroying many Naragi while at it. Feeling remorse for his actions, Saradomin attempts to defend the realm from Tuska, but is eventually forced to leave after other gods arrive. Soon, a god named Skargaroth, in possession of a sword created by the Elder Gods, arrives and begins to fight Tuska. The war eventually leads to the complete extinction of the Naragi race and the destruction of their society and realm.

                                    Towards the end of the Naragi God Wars, Skargaroth accidentally crushes the house of one of the last Naragi, named Guthix, killing the latter's daughter, Aagi. In anger, Guthix takes Skargaroth's sword and blinds Tuska with it, causing her to flee the dimension. He then stabs Skargaroth in the back, killing the god while becoming one himself. Seeing his dead friends and family, Guthix mourns and leaves the realm, creating dimensional rifts using his sword.

                                    The new god of balance visits many worlds, such as Zanaris, the home world of the dwarves and the home world of the elves. On Tarddiad, he meets and befriends Seren. After creating the World Gate, Guthix's sword is shattered and becomes too dangerous to use.

                                    Tormented by Jas's curse and unable to stop the False Users from using the Stone of Jas, the Dactyl faction of Dragonkin, led by Kerapac, decide to rebel and kill their mistress. While they do not die of age, Dragonkin can be killed and are unable to reproduce. As such, the Dactyl conduct many experiments, leading to a decimation of their ranks, in an attempt to create creatures similar to them in power, but able to reproduce and not bound to Jas. This results in the creation of dragons, who are deemed failures by the Dragonkin for their inability to match their desires.  Folklore calls these first dragons the "Elder Dragons" and it is even said they are connected to the Anima Mundi to the extent that, in case of their death, the Anima Mundi itself is destroyed. However, this is almost definitely false. Another faction of the Dragonkin called the Necrosyrtes creates dragon metal, and are said to have done this on Freneskae.
